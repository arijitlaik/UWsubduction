## Overview

This package (UWsubduction) hosts code related to the simulation of thermo-mechanical subduction Underworld2. This code was developed by Dan Sandiford and Louis Moresi at the University of Melbourne.

The code is designed to facilitate simple development of 2D parallel thermo-mechanical subduction experiments. He you will find the the source code, examples designed to get you started, and a place to post issues when things don't work.


## Getting started

The TectModel class is abstraction of a 2D plate-tectonic system, based on a (directed) graph. In fact, we build directly on top of the Python networkx DiGraph object.

## Installation
