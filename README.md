## Overview

This package (UWsubduction) hosts code related to the simulation of thermo-mechanical subduction Underworld2. This code was developed by Dan Sandiford and Louis Moresi at the University of Melbourne.

The code is designed to facilitate simple development of 2D parallel thermo-mechanical subduction experiments. He you will find the the source code, examples designed to get you started, and a place to post issues when things don't work.


## Getting started

The `.\Background` directory contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that introduce some of the key objects (Classes) that we have implemented, and are used in the Examples.

The `.\Examples` directory contains a series of subduction models (as Jupyter notebooks). While notebooks can be run in serial at low resolution, the models can and are intended to be run in parallel.
